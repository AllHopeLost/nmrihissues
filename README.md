**No More Room in Hell**
===========

This readme is for the Half-Life 2 Source Mod "No More Room in Hell".

The main purpose of this repository is to submit any bugs or issues present in the modification.

**Reporting Issues**
--------------

If you would like to report an issue you've found in the mod, please check the issue list to see if it's been reported. Include closed issues in your search.

Also consult this [link](http://www.nomoreroominhell.com/forums/index.php?showforum=57) for preexisting issues (we'll slowly move the current issues over to this system, but feel free to help out)

If the issue hasn't been reported yet, submit it in GitHub with the following information:

* A short descriptive title
* Detailed information of the issue (what happens if it occurs, etc.) along with any screenshots or output from the developer console (accessible in game via ` key)
* Steps on how to reproduce the issue (How did you do it?)
* And if possible, system information*

Place Developer Console output in a blockquote (Press M while in your web browser for a cheat sheet on how to do that)

*Easiest way to obtain your system information is through Steam (Help > System Information). Copy and paste all of that information into your bug report, in a blockquote.

**Code of Conduct**
--------------

Since this will ideally be used by the public to help centralize and organize the issues present in the mod, the team would appreciate if you can remember the following:

* Do not insult, harass, or demean anyone.
* Do not intentionally multi-post an issue.
* Avoid using ALL CAPS when creating an issue report.
* Do not repeatably update an open issue, saying that the issue persists.

Reminder: NMRiH is a HL2 modification so some issues that you'll find may be common throughout various Source 2007 based mods (ex: clientregistry.blob error) or may not even be issues at all.
